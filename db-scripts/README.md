Database scripts
----------------

This directory contains database scripts needed in production environment 

The database scripts are generated by running `generate-archive-functions.sh` 
script, which will read `tables.data` to get the list of tables and their columns. 
The template of the SQL function to archive the tables is built into the 
`generate-archive-functions.sh` script, and should be edited there, if changes
are needed. After changes are done, generated the sql script again and run at least the
`DbArchiveSpec` test.  

In `tables.data`, for each table for which we want to generate archive function 
there should be one line in format:

    tablename: column1, column2, ...
